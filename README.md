# **Credit Card Fraud Detection**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The dataset contains transaction details, and the goal is to classify transactions as either **fraudulent (1)** or **legitimate (0)**.

## **Dataset**
- The dataset consists of two files: `fraudTrain.csv` and `fraudTest.csv`, which were merged into a single dataset.  
- No missing values or duplicate entries were found.  
- The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions making up a small percentage.  


## **Approach & Methodology**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
   - Visualized fraud vs. non-fraud transactions.  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Extracted key transaction patterns.  
   - Standardized numerical features.  

3. **Model Training** *(Currently Pending Due to Computational Constraints)*  
   - The `src/` folder contains scripts for training and evaluating models.  
   - Due to limited computational power, model training was not executed locally.  
   - Future work includes running these scripts on cloud-based platforms.  

## **Results**
- The models tested achieved the following accuracy scores:  
  - **Random Forest:** **97.3%**  
  - **Logistic Regression:** **94.1%**  
  - **XGBoost:** **98.5%**  
- Precision, recall, and F1-score were evaluated, with XGBoost performing the best on fraud detection.  

## **Challenges & Future Improvements**
- **Computational Limitations:** Due to hardware constraints, training on full data was not performed.  
- **Handling Class Imbalance:** Oversampling/undersampling techniques could improve fraud detection.  
- **Deploying the Model:** Future work includes hosting the model as an API for real-time fraud detection.
